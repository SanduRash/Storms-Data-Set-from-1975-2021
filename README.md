# Storms-Data-Set-from-1975-2021

I conduct an exploratory data analysis to identify patterns and relationships within the dataset.

The data includes the positions and attributes of storms from 1975 to 2021. Storms from 1979 onward are measured every six hours during the lifetime of the storm. This has 19066 observations and 13 variables.<br/> 
<br/> name: Storm Name 
<br/> year, month, and day: Date of report
<br/> hour: Hour of report (in UTC)
<br/> lat, and long: Location of storm center
<br/> status: Storm classification (Tropical Depression, Tropical Storm, or Hurricane)
<br/> category: Saffir-Simpson hurricane category calculated from wind speed.

<br/>
As a result, I could visualize frequency trends over time and by category, identify peak activity months, investigate the relationship between wind speed, air pressure and 
their correlation using a linear regression model.
